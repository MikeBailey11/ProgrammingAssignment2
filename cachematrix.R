  ##              1. set the matrix

  ##              3. set the inverse
  ##              4. get the inverse
  ##         this list is used as the input to cacheSolve()

## cacheSolve(): computes the inverse of the "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix(). It checks if the inverse has already been calculated 
## and the matrix has not changed, if it has the function retrieves the 
## inverse from the cache itself and dose not do the computation.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  ## @x: output of makeCacheMatrix()
  ## return: inverse of the original matrix input to makeCacheMatrix()

  # otherwise, calculates the inverse

  inv = solve(mat.data, ...)
  
  # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
